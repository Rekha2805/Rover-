# 🛰️ Rover Control and Monitoring Dashboard

A real-time web application built using **Streamlit** to **monitor and control a rover** using REST APIs. The dashboard supports **auto and manual driving modes**, shows **live sensor data**, detects **obstacles and RFID tags**, and plots a **real-time path and battery chart** for the rover.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Start a rover session and fetch real-time data via APIs  
- 🎮 Manual control (forward, backward, left, right, stop)  
- 🤖 Auto mode: Rover moves randomly and charges when battery is low  
- 🧠 Obstacle and RFID detection mapped on coordinates  
- 📉 Live-updating charts for:
  - Rover path map
  - Battery level over time
- 📡 Displays live sensor data (obstacles, RFID tags, battery, etc.)  
- ☁️ Built with Python, Streamlit, and Matplotlib

## 🔐 API Endpoints Used

- `POST /api/session/start` – Start a rover session  
- `GET /api/rover/status` – Fetch current coordinates and battery  
- `GET /api/rover/sensor-data` – Get latest sensor readings  
- `POST /api/rover/move` – Move rover in a direction  
- `POST /api/rover/stop` – Stop rover movement  
- `POST /api/rover/charge` – Start rover charging  

> 📍 **Note:** APIs are hosted on [https://roverdata2-production.up.railway.app](https://roverdata2-production.up.railway.app)
